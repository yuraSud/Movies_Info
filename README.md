# Interesting numbers
A program designed to display interesting facts about numbers. The user has the opportunity to select any number or let the application choose a random number. It is also possible to select a range of numbers and even a date. 
Also, as an addition, a firebase has been introduced with the ability to initialize the user and save the number of requests in the user profile.

### Why did I write this project?
___
In order to show your capabilities as a portfolio, and to acquire new and improve old skills and technologies.
I really enjoy writing code. Create applications from simple to complex multi-level ones. This really fascinates me...
